# Simple-Generative-AI-Model

This repo explains about an artificial intelligence (AI) system called the Generative AI Text Generation Model aims to produce new material that closely mimics the input data. It creates new material that is stylistically and grammatically comparable to the original data by using machine learning algorithms to analyse and comprehend the patterns and features of a corpus of text or other given set of data. These algorithms can produce everything from little phrases to lengthy books and articles as text.

Text generation models create new text using a range of methods, such as rule-based models, language models, and neural networks. Language models utilise statistical techniques to create text based on the likelihood of specific word sequences, as opposed to rule-based models, which use sets of predetermined rules. On the other hand, neural networks are a form of machine learning algorithm that can learn to produce text by analysing huge text databases.
